# PyBer Analysis
Analyzing and visualizing ridesharing data with Python.
## Overview
The purpose of this project is performing an analysis of ride sharing data by city type and how they differ in order to improve ride sharing services.
## Results

Based on the data that was given to me, I created this data frame sorted by each city type and an overview based on different factors like total rides, drivers, and fares as well as the average of fares per driver and ride.
By analyzing the this data frame, I have come to a few conclusions
- Urban cities have the highest rides by far. They have more rides than Rural and Suburban cities combined.
- Urban cities also have almost 5x as many drivers as Suburban and almost 30x more than Rural drivers.
- Suburban cities have about 6x as many drivers as Rural and about 4.5x the revenue.
- Rural cities have the highest average fare per driver and ride.

Below is a line chart based on the total fare by city type.

## Summary
According to the analysis based on the data frame and line chart, I think that increasing the amount of drivers in the Rural areas are what is best for the business. Since the Rural rides give the higher average fares per ride and driver compared to the Suburban and Urban cities, it makes more sense to increase the number of drivers in that area. This can also be due to Rural residences generally taking longer distance rides compared to Suburban and Urban riders. However, this can be an issue with drivers because of the potential loss of revenue during busy hours of the day due to the time and distance.
